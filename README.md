This is a direct port over from Idael Cardoso's original implementation found at [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/audio-video/ManWMF.aspx)

In order to build with all it's dependencies for the right platforms you will need to install Ruby 1.9.2. Then from the command line run:
`gem install rake`
`gem install bundler`
Navigate via command line to the directory where you pulled the source down, and from the command line run:
`bundler install`
Now that setup is complete run `rake build`
